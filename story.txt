Once upon a time there was cat named cat, he was a fat cat.
This is an exploitation-style tale. The story is about a young park ranger. It starts in an ancient empire. The issues of genetic engineering and its. effects on economics is a major element of the story.I like the time that I spent with the dog.
Now Cat and Fog are bestfriends.

The End.
