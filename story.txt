This is an exploitation-style tale. The story is about a young park ranger. It starts in an ancient empire. The issues of genetic engineering and its effects on economics is a major element of the story.I like the time that I spent with the dog.

They offer these mash-ups of random details that don’t make any sense, and require the writer to sift out the irrelevant details and find the connections. Or worse yet, they make you fill out some kind of form to get a nonsensical outline.

This story generator works differently.

Each prompt gives a character and a scenario, and asks a leading question that will get you started on fleshing out the storyline. It contains hundreds of story scenarios that should spur you to write.

Remember to change details as you see fit. Change the gender of the character, or the gender of the person they’re in love with, or the location, or their job. The sole goal of this story idea generator is to inspire you to write, so don’t feel like you have to stay true to the prompt.

Another distinction between this story idea generator and others: While other creative writing prompts want you to do a small exercise or to master a technique, these are designed to spur your creativity into writing a full story.
The End.
